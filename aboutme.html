            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my page! I'm Elif Polat, a passionate and dedicated architecture student based in Istanbul, Turkey. My journey in the world of architecture began with a deep love for design and creativity. Born and raised in Istanbul, I have always been fascinated by the intricate blend of history and modernity that defines this vibrant city.</p>
            <p>After completing my primary education, I pursued my passion for the arts by studying ballet at the Mimar Sinan Fine Arts Conservatory. I continued my academic journey at Burak Bora Anatolian High School. Currently, I am a fourth-year architecture student at Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University, where I am continuously inspired by the rich architectural heritage of Istanbul.</p>
            <p>Alongside my studies, I also work part-time at CM Architecture Office, gaining valuable real-world experience in the field. This practical exposure complements my academic learning, allowing me to bridge theory with practice.</p>
            <p>Outside of architecture, I enjoy exploring new cultures, traveling, and capturing moments through photography. These experiences often inspire my architectural designs, infusing them with diverse influences and perspectives.</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my page, and I hope you enjoy learning more about my journey and passion for architecture.</p>
